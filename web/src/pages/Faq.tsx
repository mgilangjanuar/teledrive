            Q: What is TeleDrive?
          </Typography.Title>
          <Typography.Paragraph>
            A: If you ever heard about cloud storage services like Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, Dropbox &mdash; TeleDrive is one of them, you can upload photos, videos, documents, or any files for free. But, what makes TeleDrive different? We're using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api#telegram-api" target="_blank">Telegram API</a>, so you can do uploads without limit and free.
          </Typography.Paragraph>
          <Typography.Paragraph>
            Telegram allows us to <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id" target="_blank">create our Telegram application</a> for free as long as it does not violate the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/terms" target="_blank">terms</a>. So, TeleDrive is a third-party application of Telegram that utilizes their APIs for cloud storage service.
          </Typography.Paragraph>

            Q: Who is TeleDrive for?

            A: Everyone who deserves free unlimited cloud storage services. Developers, students, etc. We just compare the irrational pricing for others cloud storage services: <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>, <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/individual/plans-comparison" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238" target="_blank">iCloud</a> &mdash;

            Q: How it works?
          </Typography.Title>
          <Typography.Paragraph>
            A: For authentication and authorization flow, we're using <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/auth" target="_blank">this flow</a>. First, we need a valid phone number and hit <a href="https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.sendCode" target="_blank">send code</a> method to the Telegram API, then <a href="https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.signIn" target="_blank">sign in</a> with the 5 digits code that is sent to the user's Telegram account.
            If the code has expired, we use <a href="https://core.telegram.org/method/auth.resendCode" target="_blank">resend code</a> method. After that, we got the session key. TeleDrive will wrap the session with the <a href="https://jwt.io/" target="_blank">JWT</a> method to make you securely access other private endpoints, like upload, download, get file lists, etc. We do not store your session in any storage or database.
          </Typography.Paragraph>
          <Typography.Paragraph>
            For upload and download flow, we're using the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/method/upload.getFile" target="_blank">get file</a> and <a href="https://core.telegram.org/method/upload.saveBigFilePart" target="_blank">save big file part</a> methods. For every file a user uploads, it gets uploaded in chunks and passed to Telegram. So, you can't reload or close the browser if it's still uploading. All files that you upload will be
            saved in the Saved Messages in your Telegram application. TeleDrive does not save your file on the server or anywhere else. So, only you that can access those files unless you share them with someone.
          </Typography.Paragraph>
          <Typography.Title level={5}>
            Q: How secure is TeleDrive?
          </Typography.Title>
          <Typography.Paragraph>
            A: As we explain in the previous question, we fully using the Telegram API for the authentication process. For the authorization flow, we using multiple verifications to hit the private endpoints in the TeleDrive APIs. First, we need to verify the auth token with the secret token that is saved in the secret environment variable in the server. Then, we check the session to the Telegram API to revalidate whether it's you.

            Tl;dr it's safe.
